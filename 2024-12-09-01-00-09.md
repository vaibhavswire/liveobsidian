Stobha (स्तोभ):—(bhaḥ) 1. m. Stopping; disrespect; division of the Sāma Veda. Stobha (स्तोभ) in the Sanskrit language is related to the Prakrit words: Thobha, Thobhaya.

A stotra or "laud" is the chant of a certain number of stanzas (rk's), put to melody, i.e., chanted on or according to one of the numerous melodies or ways of chanting (saman's), which are recorded in the gramegeyagana or in the aranyegeyagana of the Samavedic texts.

A stoma, on the contrary, designates the number of the chanted verses either during a whole day of the Soma-sacrifice or during a part of it. The regular stomas are the trivrt, the pancadasa, the saptadasa, the ekavimsa, the pancavimsa, the trinava, the trayastrimsa, the catuscatvarimsa and the astacatvarimsa, i.e., the nine-versed, the fifteen-versed, the seventeen-versed stoma, etc. 1 Sometimes the word stoma denotes simply: yajna: a sacrifice of Soma, as e.g. Marutstoma, Sunaskarnastoma (elsewhere called sunaskarnayajna

For the three pavamana-lauds (the out-of-doors-laud, the middaypavamana-laud and the arbhava pavamana-laud), which are the first ones of each savana (morning- midday- and afternoon-service) the Samavedic texts give each time the stanzas in full on which they are to be chanted, for instance the bahispavamana or out-of doors-laud of the normal catustoma agnistoma is chanted on SV. II. 1-9 (CalandHenry, l'Agnistoma, § 134. g), the midday-pavamana-laud on SV. II. 22-29 (C. H. § 178. b), the arbhavapavamana laud on SV. II. 39-52 (C H. §221. b). For all the other lauds only tycas (i.e. complexes of three stanzas) or pragathas (i.e., complexes of two stanzas) are recorded in the Samavedic texts. A pragatha is turned into a tristich in the manner described in C. H. § 199. b, page 307. By repetition of these three stanzas the required number of stotra-verses is obtained. In which manner this repetition is to be made (i.e., how a stoma is to be formed out of the three stanzas of a hymn) is explained in the two following Chapters of the Brahmana, which treat of the vistuti's the different modes of getting out of a trca the number of verses required for the laud. " A vistuti comprises always three rounds, three sections: paryaya's. each of which should contain each stanza in different or equal numbers; the first part (vistava) of a paryaya is called trcabhaga, the second avapa (sthana), the third paricara (sc. rk). In the second paryaya this order is changed and again in the third. Each of these rounds," is introduced by the syllable him (hum, in the chant). So, for example, of the first vistuti (the udyati, II. 1) the first paryaya consists of the thrice chanted first stanza introduced by the syllable him, the second paryaya consists of the thrice repeated second stanza equally introduced by him, and the third paryaya of the thrice chanted third stanza of the tristich, introduced by him So the schema is: hum 1. 1. 1; hum 2. 2. 2; hum 3. 3. 3. In which manner the Prastotr has to mark and control the stanzas chanted, is explained in C. H. § 155, page 237 and cp. § 142. o, page 195. II. 1. 1. For three (verses) he1 makes him, he (chants) the first (verse of the tristich thrice); for three (verses) he makes him, he (chants) the middle (one thrice); for three (verses) he makes him, he (chants) the last (one thrice). This is the 'ascending' vistuti
