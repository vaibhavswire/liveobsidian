To design and publish maps for **Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)**, follow these steps:

### **Designing the Map:**

1. **Download the Necessary Tools:**
   - Ensure you have the **CS2 SDK** (Software Development Kit) and **Hammer World Editor**. These tools are essential for map creation and can be downloaded from the Steam Tools Library if you have Counter-Strike 2 installed.[](https://isp.page/news/how-to-play-custom-workshop-maps-in-counter-strike-2-cs2/)

2. **Learn Hammer World Editor:**
   - Familiarize yourself with Hammer's interface. Use online resources, tutorials, and guides to understand the basic functionalities like creating structures, applying textures, setting up lighting, and placing game entities.[](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/technologies/gp2721-how-to-make-a-cs2-map-a-step-by-step-guide/)

3. **Create Your Map:**
   - Start with a simple design, focusing on layout and gameplay mechanics before adding detailed textures and props. Remember, performance optimization is crucial for multiplayer maps.[](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/How_to_Develop_a_Map_That_Works)

4. **Test and Refine:**
   - After designing your map, test it in-game by loading it via the console command `map [your map name]`. Playtest extensively, ideally with friends or bots, to ensure gameplay balance and fix any bugs or issues.[](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/technologies/gp2721-how-to-make-a-cs2-map-a-step-by-step-guide/)

### **Publishing the Map:**

1. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Before publishing, optimize your map to ensure it runs smoothly on different hardware configurations. This might involve simplifying complex geometries or optimizing lighting setups.[](https://www.re-thinkingthefuture.com/technologies/gp2721-how-to-make-a-cs2-map-a-step-by-step-guide/)

2. **Upload to Steam Workshop:**
   - Open CS2, use the console command `workshop_publish`. In the publishing window, select "Map", fill in the details, add a description, and upload screenshots. Browse to your map's .bsp file in the `csgo\maps` directory to select it for publishing.[](https://hellcase.com/blog/guides/create-your-own-maps-in-cs-go/)

3. **Community Engagement:**
   - Once published, promote your map on community forums, social media, and through gameplay streams to gather feedback and increase visibility. This step isn't part of publishing but helps your map gain attention.[](https://x.com/CounterStrike/status/1805732572133310560)

Remember, while these steps outline the process, engaging with the community for feedback and iterating based on playtests can significantly enhance your map's quality and popularity. Also, ensure your map adheres to Valve's content guidelines to avoid any issues with publication.
