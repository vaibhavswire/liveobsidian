2.8 billion in the last five years. Three Indian gaming companies, Game 24X7, Dream11, and Mobile Premier League, have even achieved unicorn status, further bolstering the market. In terms of regulatory progress, India has taken steps to provide legal certainty to the expanding gaming industry. The Information Technology Rules of 2021, amended in 2023, explicitly acknowledge online gaming as a form of entertainment, social interaction, and economic activity. These rules recognize online gaming platforms and the transactions conducted within them, including virtual currency and virtual goods, as legally valid and enforceable. This recognition ensures the protection of participants in online gaming activities under the law, instilling trust and fostering industry growth. The regulations also introduce a self-regulation model for the online gaming sector involving real money. Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) will approve games that can operate in India in accordance with the rules. Online gaming platforms are required to register themselves under one of the three recognized SROs. These regulations address concerns about integrity and fairness in online gaming practices, establishing a regulatory foundation for the industry. However, some aspects of the regulations have been met with criticism. The focus on disallowing wagering games while lacking clarity on governing the movement of money and user integrity is seen as encouraging law avoidance. The definition of addiction provided by the amendments primarily focuses on gambling addiction or situations involving the exchange of money, disregarding the psychological and social impact of online gaming. Additionally, outsourcing authority to SROs raises concerns about the lack of clarity regarding governance measures to reduce gaming addiction and unethical use of gaming platforms. By the chapter, the authors would like to map the significant progress that these regulations have made in providing legal certainty and establishing regulations for the online gaming industry, but also highlight the areas where further clarity and comprehensive governance measures are needed. A comparative analysis would be done to cherry-pick regulations on issues like the movement of money, user integrity, and the broader impact of online gaming on individuals. A holistic regulatory framework targeting the industry and consumers is crucial for fostering a responsible and sustainable gaming ecosystem in the country.
