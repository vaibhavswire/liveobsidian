The volcanic explosivity index (VEI) is a scale used to measure the size of explosive volcanic eruptions. It was devised by Christopher G. Newhall of the United States Geological Survey and Stephen Self in 1982.

From 1340 to 1400, the world's population fell from an estimated 443 million to 350–375 million,[19] with the Indian subcontinent suffering the most tremendous loss and Europe suffering the Black Death pandemic;[20]

The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393,[22] presumably from a combination of Mongol invasions, famine, and plague.[23]
